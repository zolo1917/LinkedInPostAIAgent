            <p>Bengaluru-based Hatti Kaapi, a homegrown coffee chain with outlets in several Indian cities, has launched a range of vegan filter coffee. </p>
            <p>
                The brand currently has 115 stores and is planning to expand their retail footprint to over 200 stores.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hatti Kaapi partnered with Oatey, an Indian oatmilk startup, to introduce an oatmilk-based range of vegan filter coffee and masala chai at their highly popular Indiranagar outlet and the newly-launched outlet inside the Bangalore Club.

            <p>The climate crisis is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, scientists have warned. Organizations around the world have established initiatives to tackle the environmental emergency. One such effort is the Paris Agreement, which sees nearly 200 countries committing to reduce their emissions.</p>

            <p>
                The Paris Agreement is undoubtedly an important step in reducing humankindâ€™s impact on the planet. One campaign aims to extend the initiative by putting food systems at the forefront of the issue.
